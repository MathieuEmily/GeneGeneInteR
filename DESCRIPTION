Description: The aim of this package is to propose several methods for testing gene-gene interaction in case-control association studies. Such a test can be done by aggregating SNP-SNP interaction tests performed at the SNP level (SSI) or by using gene-gene multidimensionnal methods (GGI) methods. The package also proposes tools for a graphic display of the results.
